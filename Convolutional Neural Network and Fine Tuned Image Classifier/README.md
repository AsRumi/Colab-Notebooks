# Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch and fine-tuning VGG16 for image classification

In this notebook, I have created a CNN model from scratch using Keras APIs for classifying images of cats and dogs. Later into the notebook, I have also fine-tuned the VGG-16 network to perform the same task. All my trained models can be found in the '/models' folder in the form of a Google Drive link (file exceeds 25 MBs). Please reach out to me if you are in need of the image dataset used to train these models.

## Dataset Description
* Total size: *~100 MB*
* A balanced dataset containing 2000 images of each class, a total of 4000 images.
* 2000 images used for training, 1000 for validation during training, and 1000 for testing after training.
